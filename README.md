## KK Study Rules
Branch Management: Each participant should create a branch specific to their project. Within the top-level directory of each branch, create a folder named after yourself and perform your project-related work inside that folder.
Branch Merging: Branches are scheduled to be merged into the main branch at the end of each month.
Contributions: You can contribute to each other's projects through their respective branches. When doing so, it is essential to follow the practice of sending a Pull Request.
Documentation: Each project must include a README.md file to share the project's objectives and progress.
